# Car License Plate Reader

## Overview
The Car License Plate Reader is a machine learning-based application designed to detect and read vehicle license plates. It uses advanced image processing techniques to isolate license plates in an image, then employs Tesseract OCR to read and interpret the plate numbers.

## Key Features
- License plate detection using machine learning models.
- Image masking to isolate license plates for analysis.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract to read plate numbers.
- Suitable for automated systems like parking management or traffic monitoring.

## Technical Details
- The application first detects the license plates using a trained ML model.
- Applies image masking to focus on the license plate area.
- Uses Tesseract OCR for converting image-based text to machine-readable format.
